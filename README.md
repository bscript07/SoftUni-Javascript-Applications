# JS Applications

In the "JS Applications" course, students will learn what HTTP requests are and how to use them. They will get acquainted with REST Services, what a BaaS (Backend as a Service) is, and how to work with it. The course will also cover what asynchronous code means (Promises, using async/await), and explain Templating and Routing. During the course, students will create a Single Page Application, using the techniques learned in previous lectures, which will be assessed. They will understand the architecture of an application and how to properly structure their applications. By the end of the course, they will explore different design patterns and their practical applications, create their own web components using the Web Components standard, and build a Webpack environment from scratch.
